# CSS Flexbox Layout
## Smarter Layouts with flex-basis and flex
### Video review

- `flex` and `flex-basis` apply to **flex items** only.
- `flex-basis` specifies the initial main size of a flex item.
- You set the initial size you want the flex items to be, then flexbox evenly distributes the free space according that size.
- `flex` is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-basis` and `flex-shrink`.
- Using only one number value for `flex` sets the `flex-grow` value of an item.
- The second and third values are optional in the `flex` shorthand.
- Setting only one number value for `flex` automatically sets the `flex-basis` value to `0`.
