# CSS Flexbox Layout
## Distributing Space Inside a Flex Container
### Video review

- You apply the `justify-content` property to **flex containers** only.
- The `justify-content` property lets you control the position and
	alignment of flex Items on the main axis and how space should be distributed in a flex container.
- The default value for `justify-content` is `flex-start`, which
	places items towards the start of each flex line.
- To place items at the end of the flex line, set `justify-content`
	to `flex-end.`
- The value center places flex items in the center of the line,
	with equal amounts of empty space between the line's start edge and the first item.
- The value `space-between` displays equal spacing between flex
	items.
- For equal spacing around every flex item, use the value `space-around.`
- A margin set to auto will absorb any extra space around a flex
	item and push other flex items into different positions.
