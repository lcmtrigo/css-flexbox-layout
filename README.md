# CSS Flexbox Layout
## Wrapping Flex Items
### Video review

- The `flex-wrap` property is for **flex containers** only.
- The flex container lays out flex items on a single line called
	a **flex line.**
- The flex container tries to fit all items on one flex line,
	even if causes its contents to overflow.
- The flex container can break flex items into multiple flex lines
	and allow them to wrap as needed.
-	With the `flex-wrap` property, you can control whether the flex
	container is a single-line or multi-line layout.
- The value `wrap` breaks the flex items into multiple lines.
