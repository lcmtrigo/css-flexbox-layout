# CSS Flexbox Layout
## Growing Flex Items
### Video review

- The `flex-grow` property applies to **flex items only.**
- `flex-grow` determines how much of the available space inside the flex container an item should take up; it assigns more or less space to flex items.
- A `flex-grow` value of 1 expands flex items to take up the full space of a line.
- The higher the `flex-grow` value, the more an item grows relative to the other items.
