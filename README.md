# CSS Flexbox Layout
## Controlling the Direction of Flex Items
### Video review

- Some flexbox properties apply to the flex container only, 
	while some apply only to the flex items.
- The flex-direction property **applies to the flex 
	container only.**
- The default value for `flex-direction` is row.
- To reverse the direction flex items in a row, use the 
	value `row-reverse.`
- The value column rotates the main axis so that flex items 
	are laid out vertically.
- Like the `row-reverse` property, you can swap the 
	top-to-bottom direction of a column with the value 
	`column-reverse.`
