## Changing the Order of Flex Items
### Video review

- The order property applies to **flex items** only.
- We can use the `order` property to change the order of any flex item.
- You can structure an HTML document for SEO or accessibility first, then rearrange the content without ever editing the HTML.
- The default order of all flex items is `0`.
- order places flex items relative to the other items' `order` values.
- To place a flex item before another item, it needs to have a lower `order` value than the item.
- To place a flex item after another item, it needs to have a higher `order` value than the item.
